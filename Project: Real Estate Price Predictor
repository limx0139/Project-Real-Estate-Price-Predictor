Project: Real Estate Price Predictor

Actors: User; System; Prospective Sellers;

Usecase: PredictPrice;

PredictPrice.desc: 
    User input location and housing specs
    System outputs predicted price range(data reference from database)
    System outputs links to prospective sellers(rather challenging to implement)


Databases to incorporate: 
    HDB housing data

Possible Issues: 
    Prices can fluctuate with time, likely data will quickly become outdated.
    HDB database already exists //https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB33RTIS/BB33PReslTrans.jsp
        Addressing the issue: 
            add predicted costs based on current trends and previous costs to more accurately predict the current costs
            Include other datasets rather than just HDB housing options
